 * public void CollectItem(GameObject item)	Pick up an item from the level which is within reach of the agent and put it in the inventory. Takes a GameObject representing the item as a parameter.
 * public void DropItem(GameObject item)	Drop an inventory item or the flag at the agents’ location. Takes a GameObject representing the item as a parameter.
 * public void UseItem(GameObject item)	Use an item in the inventory (currently only health kit or power up). Takes a GameObject representing the item to use as a parameter.

 * public void Flee(GameObject enemy)	Move in the opposite direction to the enemy. Takes a GameObject representing the enemy as a parameter.
 * 
 * _agentSenses properties and methods
 * public List<GameObject> GetObjectsInViewByTag(string tag)	Return a list of objects with the same tag. Takes a string representing the Unity tag. Returns null if no objects with the specified tag are in view.

 * public bool IsItemInReach(GameObject item)	Checks if we are close enough to a specific collectible item to pick it up), returns true if the object is close enough, false otherwise.
 * public bool IsInAttackRange(GameObject target)	Check if we're with attacking range of the target), returns true if the target is in range, false otherwise.
 * 
 * _agentInventory properties and methods
 * public bool AddItem(GameObject item)	Adds an item to the inventory if there's enough room (max capacity is 'Constants.InventorySize'), returns true if the item has been successfully added to the inventory, false otherwise.
 * public GameObject GetItem(string itemName)	Retrieves an item from the inventory as a GameObject, returns null if the item is not in the inventory.
 * public bool HasItem(string itemName)	Checks if an item is stored in the inventory, returns true if the item is in the inventory, false otherwise.
 * 
 * You can use the game objects name to access a GameObject from the sensing system. Thereafter all methods require the GameObject as a parameter.
